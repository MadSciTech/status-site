<p>During a normal maintenance window our Software Defined Network (SDN) Controller went offline for upgrades, however it failed to start after the upgrade.</p>
<p>We are in the process of recovery the controller.</p>
<p>What does that mean we manage your network devices, we are unable to change settings on your devices. However, the devices <strong>do not</strong> need the SDN Controller available to continue function. Your equipment will continue to work, however any statistics will be lost.</p>
<p>We will update this post with additional information, when it becomes available.</p>

<p><strong>Update</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>2021-07-16 at 3:50PM CDT</strong><br>We have found the cause of the problem and are attempting a fix now.</li>
<li><strong>2021-07-16 at 11:50PM CDT</strong><br>We have resolved the issue with our SDN Controller and has returned to nominal state.</li>

        <p>On June 8, 2021 starting at approximately 5:39PM CDT, our alerting system informed us that are primary web and database server became unresponsive from the greater Internet.</p>
<p>Upon investigation, we found that our Data Center (DC) provider is having a connectivity issue across there entire global footprint. The DC provider has started investigating this large scale issue.</p>
<p><strong>As of 11:30PM on June 8, 2021 we do not have any further information to share.</strong></p>
<p><strong>UPDATE: June 8, 2021 @ 11:55PM</strong>: Web Sites &amp; Services Started to be restored and coming back online. We are still waiting for additional information from the DC about these restorations. We are assuming this may be temporary and some or all services may become intermittent at times. Additional Updates when available.</p>
<p>Once we know more, will update this post and our <a href="https://twitter.com/madscitechcloud">twitter account</a>.</p>

        <p>On May 20, 2021 we were informed that our Managed Web Service Server has been blacklisted from sending emails directly. This was a change by Spamhaus by placing the server address on a Policy Based Blacklist due to bad neighbors in our data center provider.</p>
<p>We are looking into options to remove our IP address from Spamhaus - <em>this is unlikely to happen</em>.</p>
<p>However, we have decided to continue to implement our plans to switch to using our third-party mail delivery service for all web applications.</p>
<p>We will post updates on this situation as they come available.</p>

        <p>First off, I would like to apologize for this unexpected outage to our valued clients.</p>
<p>Our recent managed mail service outage that was between <strong>12:17A - 12:35A on September 10, 2020</strong>, was a result of a missed announcement of an upcoming maintenance window by our Data Center Provider to resolve an issue with the underlying server that our Managed Mail Service is hosted on. This maintenance window was missed due to multiple maintenance notices for the Month of September.</p>
<p><strong>The maintenance window was scheduled for</strong>:</p>
<p><strong>Start</strong>: 2020-09-10 @ 04:00 UTC / Sept 9, 2020 @ 11:00PM CDT
<strong>End</strong>: 2020-09-10 @ 12:00 UTC / Sept 10, 2020 @ 7:00AM CDT</p>
<p>Live migration was attempted, however, failed and an offline migration had to be performed. An offline migration requires the Managed Mail Server to be powered off before the migration process. This offline migration caused the outage and extended the downtime.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline of Events</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>12:17A - Data Center Provider Attempt Live Migration of Mail Server to the new host, but fails</li>
<li>12:22A - System Monitoring: Notification that Mail Server is unavailable</li>
<li>12:24A - Started investigating</li>
<li>12:28A - Found that Data Center is performing offline migration of Server</li>
<li>12:30A - Migration Completed</li>
<li>12:35A - Server back online</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned above, there are other upcoming maintenance windows scheduled for September 2020, below is the upcoming maintenance windows:</p>
<ul>
<li>September 13, 2020 (CDT) - Hypervisor/Network Upgrades</li>
<li>September 17, 2020 (CDT) - General Data Center Maintenance</li>
</ul>
<p>Again, I would like to apologize again for this outage and I take full responsibility for this error.</p>
