        <p><strong>Update (June 6, 2016): The status for this implementation project has been moved to it own page. Please track this at the following page: <a href="http://status.services.madscitech.net/projects-status/spf-dkim-dmarc-project/">http://status.services.madscitech.net/projects-status/spf-dkim-dmarc-project/</a></strong></p>
<hr>
<p>TL;DR: We setup stuff to make imposter mail accounts a thing of the past. Scroll to the end of the article for the rollout schedule for your service(s).</p>
<p>We are planning to implement DMARC (Domain-based Message Authentication, Reporting &amp; Conformance) Records across all our own and managed mail domains in the coming weeks.</p>
<h2 id="why-are-you-implementing-dmarc-and-what-is-it">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/post/142997714451/antispam-implementation-of-dmarc/#why-are-you-implementing-dmarc-and-what-is-it">Why are you implementing DMARC and What is it?</a>
</h2>
<p>DMARC is an Internet Standard that is used to confirm that a email messages are truely from who it say it’s from. For example, when you a send email message to another mail server, the remote mail server can use DMARC records to confirm that your message is really from your mail server and not an imposter. If the message is not from the authorize mail server it will quarantine and send us reports on why it failed.</p>
<h2 id="affected-clients">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/post/142997714451/antispam-implementation-of-dmarc/#affected-clients">Affected Clients</a>
</h2>
<p>This implementation process will take a few weeks to implement and should not cause too many problems for our managed mail customers.</p>
<p>Our clients that have both Managed Mail and Web Presences on the other hand will have a slower rollout. The reason is with DMARC you must know and list all authorized hosts that can send email on behalf of your domain. If you use Email Service Providers (such as MailChimp, Amazon Web Services - Simple Email Service, Campaign Monitor, etc), web forms that send emails, and then your actual mail accounts - all these source must be included in the set of records that make DMARC.</p>
<p>We will reach out to each our Managed Web Presence Clients individually to confirm issues will not arise during this process.</p>
<h2 id="implementation-schedule">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/post/142997714451/antispam-implementation-of-dmarc/#implementation-schedule">Implementation Schedule</a>
</h2>
<p>The below is the tentative schedule for the implementation of DMARC on our managed services.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Managed Mail Clients</strong> <br>Some properties may ramp faster, depending reports
<ul>
<li>April 18, 2016: Initial Records Set (Monitor Only)</li>
<li>May 2, 2016: Set to Quarantine 1% of Email that does not conform.</li>
<li>May 5, 2016: Quarantine 5%</li>
<li>May 9, 2016: Quarantine 10%</li>
<li>May 12, 2016: Quarantine 25%</li>
<li>May 23, 2016: Quarantine 50%</li>
<li>May 30, 2016: Quarantine 75%</li>
<li>June 13, 2016: Quarantine All - Mid Point</li>
<li>June 16, 2016: Reject 1%</li>
<li>June 23, 2016: Reject 5%</li>
<li>June 30, 2016: Reject 10%</li>
<li>July 5, 2016: Reject 25%</li>
<li>July 7, 2016: Reject 50%</li>
<li>July 11, 2016: Reject 75%</li>
<li>July 18, 2016: Reject All - Complete</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Managed Web Presence &amp; Mail Client</strong> <br>The ramp for these properties will be slower, depends on reports
<ul>
<li>April 21, 2016: Initial Record Set (Monitor Only)</li>
<li>May 5, 2016: Set to Quarantine 1% of Email that does not conform.</li>
<li>May 12, 2016: Quarantine 5%</li>
<li>May 19, 2016: Quarantine 10%</li>
<li>May 26, 2016: Quarantine 25%</li>
<li>June 2, 2016: Quarantine 50%</li>
<li>June 6, 2016: Quarantine 75%</li>
<li>June 9, 2016: Quarantine All - Mid Point</li>
<li>June 20, 2016: Reject 1%</li>
<li>June 23, 2016: Reject 5%</li>
<li>June 27, 2016: Reject 10%</li>
<li>June 30, 2016: Reject 25%</li>
<li>July 7, 2016: Reject 50%</li>
<li>July 14, 2016: Reject 75%</li>
<li>July 21, 2016: Reject All - Complete</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This schedule is tentative and may vary per client needs or results or the reporting mechanism of the DMARC Standard. We will report to each client when their implementation reach the following milestones:</p>
<ul>
<li>Quarantine 50%</li>
<li>Quarantine All</li>
<li>Reject 25%</li>
<li>Reject 75%</li>
<li>Reject All</li>
</ul>

<hr>
<p>As of April 17, 2016 at 10:15PM CDT. We started recieved reports that email messages destined for Hotmail/Outlook.com email addresses were not being delivered to Hotmail/Outlook.com email accounts.</p>

<p><strong>April 17 @ 10:45PM</strong></p>
<p>We have confirmed the issue and we’re currently looking into the problem. We will update this page as soon as we have additional information to share.</p>
<h2 id="working-on-it">
  <a class="Heading-link u-clickable" href="/post/142988891971/mail-deliverability-to-hotmail/#working-on-it">Working on it</a>
</h2>
<p><strong>April 18 @ 1:00AM</strong></p>
<p>We have reached out to Microsoft, but we must wait for them to gather and report data back to us. This process may take up to 72 hours. We would like to apologize for this issue and the inconvenience this has caused our valued clients.</p>
<p>We will continue to see if we can resolve the problem from our side.</p>
<p>We will share more information as we get it.</p>
<p><strong>April 18 @ 6:00AM</strong></p>
<p>We may have found the problem. It seems that our configuration for DKIM verification may have an error in it. We are currently seeing what can be done to fix the issue, without reissuing DKIM Keys.</p>
<p><strong>April 18 @ 8:50AM</strong></p>
<p>The cause of the problem is caused by an configuration error on our DKIM configuration. Apparently when the server signed outgoing mail the domains’ DKIM it put the wrong DNS name to verify the DKIM key.</p>
<p>We will be rolling out a fix, shortly.</p>
<p>We will update this post with more information as it comes in.</p>
<p><strong>April 18 @ 11:30PM</strong></p>
<p>We have rekeyed our DKIM implementation and updated SPF Records for each client that is effected by this change. If we manage your DNS Records you have nothing to worry about, however if you manage your own DNS Records, we will be in contact with you to update your DKIM and SPF records.</p>
<p>As soon as these new DNS Records have propagated, we will be able to confirm that this issue is cleaned up.</p>
<p>We would like to apologize again for this issue and any inconvenience that it has caused you.</p>
<p><strong>April 19-20</strong></p>
<p>Update: We have discovered that Microsoft’s Hotmail.com, Outlook.com, and Live.com email accounts do not accept mail from <em>new or small email server</em> and been a documented issue with Microsoft Email Service since 2010.</p>
<p>We will be reaching out to Microsoft to request an exception for our clients and our mail server. This process may take a few business days to sort out.</p>
<p>We will share more information as we receive it, stay tune.</p>
<p>We would like to apologize again for this issue.</p>
