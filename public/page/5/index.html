        <p>On Monday, July 17, 2017, starting at 9:40 PM (CDT) our primary web server started to experience network connectivity loss. We immediately started troubleshooting the issue, we found that we couldn’t connect the server and the network path to the data center was unavailable.</p>
<p>We contacted our data center, provider. At 9:53 PM (CDT) we received confirmation that there is a network outage currently in process.</p>
<p>At 9:55 PM (CDT) our Managed Web Services came back online, slowly at first. By 10:10 PM (CDT) all services were back online and running normally.</p>
<p>The unofficial reason for this outage was a failure with a border gateway router in our data center provider’s facility. The data center provider has scheduled an upcoming maintenance window for July 25, 2017, between 02:00 - 04:00 UTC (July 24, 9 PM - July 25 11 PM).</p>
<p>Steps are already in place to attempt to prevent another outage along these lines.</p>
<p>We deeply apologize for this outage.</p>
<p>Services Effected: Websites and Web Applications.</p>

        <p>On <em>June 25, 2016</em> we have closed our Los Angeles Data Center after six years of service. Now the majority of our web services will be provided from our New York Data Center.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the staff at our Los Angeles Data Center for the help they have provided to us over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Why the change</strong></p>
<p>We decided to change our data center providers for many different reasons, the main reason is to provide our clients the best possible service. Some of the other choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster and More Powerful Servers</li>
<li>Faster Network Connections</li>
<li>Newer Software</li>
<li>Fast SSD Drives</li>
<li>New Features and Services - Faster</li>
<li>Free SSL/TLS Certificates on All Sites</li>
<li>Access to new locations
<ul>
<li>New York (Primary and Default), San Francisco, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Singapore, India and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This change will allow us to provide new and exciting opportunities for our clients.</p>
<p>We will be announcing some exciting news in the coming months because of these changes - keep an look out for it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Affected?</strong></p>
<p>This change has required us to migrate all our Managed Services and   web properties to the new infrastructure. We have been working on this migration for the last five months.</p>
<p>We’re happy to announce that the migration was 100% successful.</p>
<p>Now all of our clients’ services are running upon our new and better infrastructure - providing faster services to all.</p>
<p><strong>I have questions</strong></p>
<p>With any type of change, there will also be questions and concerns. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="https://madscitech.com/about/contact/">reach out to us</a>.</p>

<p>UPDATE June 23, 2016: We have over come the blocker. We are in the process of transferring DNS and checking things out before releasing the floodgates to the new server. We’ll update this post when we have completed the move.</p>
<p>Estimated Time: 3 Hours (2:30AM CT).</p>

<p>Starting May 25, 2016 at 7:00AM, we will begin the long process of moving our own web properties to our new server (NYC Data Center). We expect some minor downtime with the following services:</p>
<ul>
<li>MadSciTech.com Website
<ul>
<li>FAQs/Knowledge Base</li>
<li>Downloads</li>
<li>Contact Forms</li>
<li>Posting Comments to Articles (<del>Will be unavailable until Friday, May 27</del> <u>See Delay Below</u>)</li>

<p>We also expected broken links and bad redirections for parts of the MadSciTech.com website. We should have the majority of these problems corrected shortly after the DNS switched to the new server.</p>

<p>We have ran into a problem during the transferring to the new server, which is currently <em>blocking</em> us from continuing the process. We are currently looking into the problem and will update this post with the latest information, when it comes avaiable.</p>
<p>Because of this <em>blocker</em> the site is still hosted on our old server (LA Data Center) and has data entry disabled. This means that our current public site is unable to provide the following functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li>Commenting - Disabled</li>
<li>New Articles - Disabled</li>
<li>New FAQs - Disabled</li>
<li>New Videos - Disabled</li>
</ul>
<p>As mentioned, we are attempting to resolve this blocker as fast as possible to finish the move.</p>
