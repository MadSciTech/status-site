      <description>Project Status: In Progress / Partial Delay&#xA;Last Update: August 27, 2016&#xA;The timeline for this project has slipped due to the more pressing issue of mail delivery issues to Outlook.com/Hotmail.com/Live.com.&#xA;The timeline below will need to be re-evaluated due this delay. However we are happy to report that the majority of our Managed Mail Only Clients have been completely migrated to a full SPF, DKIM and DMARC Implementation. We are still monitoring the DMARC reports for problems before implementing the Quarantine and Reject functionality.</description>
