    <p>On <em>June 25, 2016</em> we have closed our Los Angeles Data Center after six years of service. Now the majority of our web services will be provided from our New York Data Center.</p>
<p>We would like to thank the staff at our Los Angeles Data Center for the help they have provided to us over the years.</p>
<p><strong>Why the change</strong></p>
<p>We decided to change our data center providers for many different reasons, the main reason is to provide our clients the best possible service. Some of the other choices include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Faster and More Powerful Servers</li>
<li>Faster Network Connections</li>
<li>Newer Software</li>
<li>Fast SSD Drives</li>
<li>New Features and Services - Faster</li>
<li>Free SSL/TLS Certificates on All Sites</li>
<li>Access to new locations
<ul>
<li>New York (Primary and Default), San Francisco, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Singapore, India and more</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This change will allow us to provide new and exciting opportunities for our clients.</p>
<p>We will be announcing some exciting news in the coming months because of these changes - keep an look out for it.</p>
<p><strong>What is Affected?</strong></p>
<p>This change has required us to migrate all our Managed Services and   web properties to the new infrastructure. We have been working on this migration for the last five months.</p>
<p>We’re happy to announce that the migration was 100% successful.</p>
<p>Now all of our clients’ services are running upon our new and better infrastructure - providing faster services to all.</p>
<p><strong>I have questions</strong></p>
<p>With any type of change, there will also be questions and concerns. If you have any questions, please feel free to <a href="https://madscitech.com/about/contact/">reach out to us</a>.</p>
