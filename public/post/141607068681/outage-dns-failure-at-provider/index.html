<p><em>March 24, 2016 - Postmortem</em></p>
<p>Our New York Data Center Provider has posted an postmortem of the cause of today’s DNS failure. The cause was due to a increase demand upon their DNS Servers Clusters - Distributed Denial of Service Attack upon the providers DNS Infrastructure. The provider will be changing their DNS Infrastructure to improve the time to mitigate DNS DDoS Attack in the future.</p>
