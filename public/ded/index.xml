      <description>On May 20, 2021 we were informed that our Managed Web Service Server has been blacklisted from sending emails directly. This was a change by Spamhaus by placing the server address on a Policy Based Blacklist due to bad neighbors in our data center provider.&#xA;We are looking into options to remove our IP address from Spamhaus - this is unlikely to happen.&#xA;However, we have decided to continue to implement our plans to switch to using our third-party mail delivery service for all web applications.</description>

This maintenance window was missed due to multiple maintenance notices for the Month of September.</description>
