    <p>Starting at <strong>11:00PM on July 26, 2019</strong>, many of our online services became unavailable due to expired security certificates.</p>
<p>This issue was caused by a silently failing scheduled task that would normally renew the certificates automatically and a notification system failing to send warnings about the expiration of said certificates.</p>
<p>It came to our attention at <strong>1:30AM July 27, 2019</strong> that the services were unavailable, we remedy the issue by 1:40AM. We will be implementing additional safe guards to prevent this issue in the future.</p>
<p>We would like to deeply apologize for this problem.</p>
