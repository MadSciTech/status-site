On **June 12, 2016 at 6:27A** our web server ran out of memory and temporarily crashed, causing websites on our Managed Web Presence Service to go offline. We quickly diagnosed and recovered the server and brought the **server back up by 6:35A**.

We are planning to do a memory upgrade on this particular server in the coming weeks, to prevent this problem from re-occurring. We will post an notice here and on our new status [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/madscitechcloud), for that particular upgrade.

_We apologize for the outage._
