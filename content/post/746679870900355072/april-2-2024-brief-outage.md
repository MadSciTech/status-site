After investigating the outage we have determined that the outage was localized to our local (Quincy) monitoring system. The outage was caused by an routing change by our local transit provider.

This outage only effected users on Adams Network/Adams Fiber between 10:39-10:52AM on April 2.

We apologize for this outage.
