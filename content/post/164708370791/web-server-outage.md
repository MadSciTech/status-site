During our server maintenance of our web server, an issue occurred that has caused the web server to stop responding. We are working as fast as possible to restore service.

We will update this post shortlyâ€¦

**Update: Aug 28 @ 6:17AM** - Web Server has recovered. Websites should be accessible now without issue.

**Cause**: The cause was due to a retired configuration file being in wrong place. We apologize for the downtime. Total downtime: 15 Minutes.
