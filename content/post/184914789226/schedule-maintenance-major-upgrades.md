We will be doing some major maintenance this weekend on all of our online services. We have divided this maintenance into two stages, due to the extensive maintenance that is required.

We expect up to 14 hours of possible downtime, however, we estimate the actual downtime will be around 4 hours for each service or a total of 8 hours.

We may not need the Stage Two Maintenance Window, however we wanted a fallback window just in case problems arised.

We will update this post during the maintenance and also on Twitter ([@MadSciTechCloud](https://twitter.com/madscitechcloud/)).
