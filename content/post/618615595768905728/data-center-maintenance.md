Our Data Center Provider will be doing maintenance on the underlaying server that we are using, to resolve a potential issue with the system.

The expected downtime is currently unknown, but may last the full maintenance window. We expect to only see a minor interruption to services - including packet loss - while our system is moved to a new system.

**Affected Services**

* Managed Web Services
* Managed Mail Services
* Our Online Services

We will update this post with additional information as we get more information.

If you have questions or concerns about this maintenance window, please feel free to [contact us](https://madscitech.com/about/contact/).
