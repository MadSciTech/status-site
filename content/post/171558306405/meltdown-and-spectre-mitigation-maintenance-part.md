Our datacenter provider has informed us that another maintenance window will be open during the above time to implement additional mitigation against the Meltdown and Spectre Exploits.

No actual downtime is expected, however network traffic may see higher than normal latency.

We will post updates here on this site and our [Twitter Account](https://twitter.com/madscitechcloud).
