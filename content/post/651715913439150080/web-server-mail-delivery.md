On May 20, 2021 we were informed that our Managed Web Service Server has been blacklisted from sending emails directly. This was a change by Spamhaus by placing the server address on a Policy Based Blacklist due to bad neighbors in our data center provider.

We are looking into options to remove our IP address from Spamhaus - _this is unlikely to happen_.

However, we have decided to continue to implement our plans to switch to using our third-party mail delivery service for all web applications.

We will post updates on this situation as they come available.

If you have any questions, please feel free to [contact us](https://madscitech.com/about/contact/).
