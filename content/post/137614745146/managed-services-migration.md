title = 'Managed Services Migration'
date = 2016-01-04
+++
In the coming weeks, we will be migrating our services to a new service provider to increase service performance and reliability.

This transition will take a few weeks to get going, but after the migration all our services will run faster and will be better off in the long run.

The following services will be affected:

* Managed Websites and Web Applications
* Databases
* Email Service (See Note)
* <abbr title="Content Distribution Network">CDN</abbr> Service
* Mad Scientist Technologies Own Properties

We do not expect major downtime for this transition, but we will inform each customer before their migration begins.

Also this migration will require our clients to update their name servers on their domain name to complete the migration.

As we get closer to the migration, we will release the new name servers name in the near future.

## Email Service

The email service will also be migrated, however this service will be migrated after all other services have been successfully migrated to the new service provider.
