During a normal maintenance window our Software Defined Network (SDN) Controller went offline for upgrades, however it failed to start after the upgrade.

We are in the process of recovery the controller.

What does that mean we manage your network devices, we are unable to change settings on your devices. However, the devices **do not** need the SDN Controller available to continue function. Your equipment will continue to work, however any statistics will be lost.

We will update this post with additional information, when it becomes available.

* **2021-07-16 at 11:50PM CDT**<br>We have resolved the issue with our SDN Controller and has returned to nominal state.
