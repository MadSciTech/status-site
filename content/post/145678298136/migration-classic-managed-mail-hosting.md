Starting **June 13, 2016** we will begin the process of migrating our older Managed Mail Hosting Services (Classic) to a new mail server.

If you do not know if your Managed Mail Service is affected, you can easily check your incoming/outgoing mail servers you use in your email client or webmail web address:

* **Classic Managed Mail Hosting Service (Affected Clients)**
  * Incoming Server IMAP or POP3
    * Mail.YourDomain.com
    * xpnv-rqhz.accessdomain.com
  * Outgoing Server SMTP
    * Mail.YourDomain.com
    * xpnv-rqhz.accessdomain.com
  * Webmail URL
    * Mail.YourDomain.com
    * YourDomain.com/.tool/webmail

* **Modern Managed Mail Hosting Service (Not Affected)**
  * Incoming (IMAP Only) and Outgoing Server (SMTP)
    * Messaging.MadSciTech.net
  * Webmail URL: mail.services.madscitech.net

If your mail account is configured to use the servers under “Modern Managed Mail Hosting Service,” you have nothing to worry about.

However, if your mail account uses the servers under “Classic Managed Mail Hosting Service,” we will be contacting you soon to schedule an appointment to migrate your mail account to our new and faster mail server.

Your mail account **_must be migrated before June 25, 2016_** or you will lose all messages stored in your account.

**End of Support for POP3**

Please Note, we will no longer support POP3 accounts on our new mail server. Users that currently use POP3 accounts can keep there offline mail messages, however after they are switched to the new server there account will be IMAP only.

We have deprecated POP3 because it is insecure and out dated in a world where you have multiple devices accessing your email account. So with your mail account, the mail server is the definetive truth of your email.

**How Long will it Take?**

Mail Migration takes between 15 Minute for small IMAP/POP3 Accounts to 3 Hours for Very Large (5GB+) IMAP Accounts.
