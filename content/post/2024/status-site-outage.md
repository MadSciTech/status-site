On November 8, 2024 start about 5:28AM CST our Status Site (https://status.madscitech.net) went offline due to an expired HTTPS certificate. We have found that the outage was caused by our strict HTTPS Issuing Policy we had configured for our domain. We have made changes to the records that control this process and should not happen in the future.
