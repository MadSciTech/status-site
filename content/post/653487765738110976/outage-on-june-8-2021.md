On June 8, 2021 starting at approximately 5:39PM CDT, our alerting system informed us that are primary web and database server became unresponsive from the greater Internet.

Upon investigation, we found that our Data Center (DC) provider is having a connectivity issue across there entire global footprint. The DC provider has started investigating this large scale issue.

**As of 11:30PM on June 8, 2021 we do not have any further information to share.**

**UPDATE: June 8, 2021 @ 11:55PM**: Web Sites & Services Started to be restored and coming back online. We are still waiting for additional information from the DC about these restorations. We are assuming this may be temporary and some or all services may become intermittent at times. Additional Updates when available.

Once we know more, will update this post and our [twitter account](https://twitter.com/madscitechcloud).
