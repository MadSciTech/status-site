Our Data Center Provider will be doing maintenance on the underlaying server that we are using, to resolve a potential issue with the system.

The expected downtime is currently unknown, but may last the full maintenance window. We expect to only see a minor interruption to services - including packet loss - while our system is moved to a new system.

**Affected Services**

* Managed Web Services
* Managed Mail Services
* All our Online Services

We will update this post with additional information as we get more information.

If you have questions or concerns about this maintenance window, please feel free to [contact us](https://madscitech.com/about/contact/).
