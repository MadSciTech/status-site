Update: As of July 22, 2016 all Managed Web Presence Properties’ have been migrated to our new transactional email service. We only have a few more changes before our DMARC, DKIM, and SPF Rollout will change to the spam and unauthorized mail monitoring process.

Original: Starting on **July 16, 2016**, we are moving our Managed Web Presence Properties’ transactional email processing, to an enterprise class email service.

We are doing this as part of our [DMARC, DKIM, and SPF rollout](http://status.services.madscitech.net/projects-status/spf-dkim-dmarc-project) to improve email quality and cut down on spamming/spoofing of email addresses.

The current plan is to rollout this change over the course of the week of July 17.

This change will not affect your normal email service (Managed Mail Service). This change is only for the email sent by your website or web application.

**What is Transactional Email**: Transactional email is email that a website/web application sends to a user of the website. Examples of transactional emails are; Order Confirmations, Password Reset, Welcome Emails, etc.
