We have resolved an long standing issue with using Microsoft Outlook Mail Clients with our mail server. As of _May 13, 2016 at 8PM_, you may use Microsoft Outlook as your email client without issues.

The Problem is due to Outlook failing to provide the computerâ€™s full name when authenticating with the mail server. Our mail service requires that all mail servers and clients to fully identify themselves to the server before accepting mail from them. This is done to prevent spammers from attacking our mail server.

_We would like to apologize again, for the long delay in getting this issue fixed._
