On _June 25, 2016_ we have closed our Los Angeles Data Center after six years of service. Now the majority of our web services will be provided from our New York Data Center.

We would like to thank the staff at our Los Angeles Data Center for the help they have provided to us over the years.

**Why the change**

We decided to change our data center providers for many different reasons, the main reason is to provide our clients the best possible service. Some of the other choices include:

 * Faster and More Powerful Servers
 * Faster Network Connections
 * Newer Software
 * Fast SSD Drives
 * New Features and Services - Faster
 * Free SSL/TLS Certificates on All Sites
 * Access to new locations
   * New York (Primary and Default), San Francisco, Toronto, London, Amsterdam, Singapore, India and more

This change will allow us to provide new and exciting opportunities for our clients.

We will be announcing some exciting news in the coming months because of these changes - keep an look out for it.

**What is Affected?**

This change has required us to migrate all our Managed Services and   web properties to the new infrastructure. We have been working on this migration for the last five months.

We’re happy to announce that the migration was 100% successful.

Now all of our clients’ services are running upon our new and better infrastructure - providing faster services to all.

**I have questions**

With any type of change, there will also be questions and concerns. If you have any questions, please feel free to [reach out to us](https://madscitech.com/about/contact/).
